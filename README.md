# Banking-Analytics-Dashboard
This project involves analyzing a banking dataset and creating insights around Loan Analysis, Deposit Analysis, and general customer behavior. I performed detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and then built a Power BI dashboard to visually present key performance indicators (KPIs).

🔍 Python EDA:
Imported the dataset and examined data structure, summary statistics, and missing values.
Created an "Income Band" feature to group customers into Low, Medium, and High income segments.
Performed:
- Univariate analysis using countplots and histograms
- Bivariate analysis (e.g., income band vs. nationality)
- Insights on features like occupation, credit card usage, risk weighting, etc.
- Focused particularly on numerical fields such as:
- Estimated Income, Credit Card Balance, Bank Loans, Deposits, and Accounts

📊 Power BI Dashboard:
Built a dashboard to visualize KPIs related to Loans and Deposits.
Key visuals included:
- Loan distribution across different occupations and income bands
- Deposit patterns by gender, nationality, and account types
- Filtering capabilities for dynamic exploration
- The dashboard allows stakeholders to quickly grasp important trends and make data-driven decisions.

🎯 Key Outcomes:
- Identified customer segments with higher loan or deposit activity
- Created a reusable, interactive dashboard for banking product teams
- Bridged the gap between raw data analysis and business reporting
